# Abstract

...no more than 10 lines!

# 1 Introduction and Background

A short general text about the area of ai that your project belongs to.

## 1.1 The problem you tried to solve

Here you describe the problem in your own words!

## 1.2 Results from the literature

Describe briefly the scientific papers or book chapters you found relevant to the problem, references to sec 8. Explain which are relevant for your project and which not and why.

### 1.3 What tools and programs are already available for the problem, or for closely related ones?

Describe these briefly.Say how you can use them, and how your work will build on them,or differ from them. Explain which are relevant for your project and which not and why.

# 2 Overview of the architecture

Describe the different parts of your program suite in detail.

**2.1 Finished work: Running modules**

**2.2 Work in progress: Modules designed but not implemented**

**2.3 Future work: Modules a future continuation may have**

# 3 Data Collection

# 4 Your methods and implementation

# 5 Results and Evaluation

What does your running code do? How does it fare against your benchmarksandinstances? Describe advantages and disadvantages, possibly in relation to other groups in this course.

# 6 Achievements and Observations:

List your own contributions. Note every group member needs to describe his/her contributions and what he /she has learned in this final project

# 7 Discussion and Conclusions

Sum up your project, suggest future extensions and improvements.

# 8 References

List relevant section numbers in the textbook,and full bibliographic references to relevant articles and papers you found (active web links help). This is a vital part of the document!

References should be cited (i.e. actually be referred to) at the appropriate place in your text,they should visibly influence your document, and they should convey as much information as possible to the reader.

A reference to a paper will start with a unique ID (numbers, letters,...) and have the following three paragraphs:

Author(s) [year of publication], "Title of paper",Journal (or conference or publisher etc.), location data (i.e., volume numbers, etc. needed to find the item),a live www link if available. Also,if the reference is to a specific topic in a book (or large survey article), it should include the section numbers or page numbers that deals with the material you are referring to.

A couple of lines saying what question the paper is attacking, and what the proposed solution is. Or what topic the reference deals with (your textbook has excellent examples in the sections entitled "Bibliographical and Historical notes").

A pointer back to where you cite this reference.

An example would look like this:

[REF1]

Turing,A.M.(1937). "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the

Entscheidungsproblem". Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society. Series 2, 42: 230-265.

The paper is about...

The most important reference to this paper in our document is in Section XYZ

# Appendices

A.Individual stories

Each group member should write one page where they describe their own contributions to the project.

B,C,...

Here you include all other information and documentation that did not fit into the report in the above sections but that you consider too important to leave out.
